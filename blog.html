        <h1>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <p>Web documents include a programming interface called the Document Object Model (DOM). Since that software may
            alter the document's structure, appearance, and content, it serves as a representation of the page. Because
            the document is represented by the DOM as nodes and objects, computer languages may communicate with the
            page.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
        <p>There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using selectors.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>getElementsByTagName()
            </li>
            <li>querySelector()
            </li>
            <li>querySelectorAll()
            </li>
            <li>getElementById()
            </li>
            <li>getElementsByClassName()
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>An HTML element is represented by the select object in the HTML DOM. The document may be used to construct
            the choose element. The getElementById()  function may be used to access the createElement() method.

        </p>

        <h1>What is event bubble?</h1>
        <p>The DOM has a notion known as event bubbling (Document Object Model). It occurs when an element receives an
            event, and that event propagates up the DOM tree through the element's parent and ancestor elements until it
            reaches the root element.

        </p>

        <h1>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
        <p>A callback function is a function that receives an input from another function and is subsequently called
            from inside the outer function to finish a task or activity. The aforementioned illustration is a
            synchronous callback since it is executed right away.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that many JavaScript activities are asynchronous, callback methods are required. Instead, it
            runs in the background when the rest of the code is being executed. The function of a callback is to run
            code in response to an event.</p>
